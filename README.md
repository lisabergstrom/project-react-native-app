# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

For this weeks project we used React Native to build a mobile app.

## The problem

I decided to build a step counter and I watched some YouTube tutorials and follow them toghether with the react native docs. 
It was tricky to understand all parts of it but in the end I managed to create a basic step counter so I am happy about that.
